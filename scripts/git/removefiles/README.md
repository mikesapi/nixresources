├── find-largest-files.py     - Used to find the largest files in a git repository.
├── README.md                 - Used to explain the contents of this directory.
└── remove-files-from-repo.sh - The script that removes files/directories listed in a text file (e.g. dummyFileList.txt)

Before using these files/scripts, copy them to the root of the git repo that you want to remove files from.
After the surgery, remove the files.
